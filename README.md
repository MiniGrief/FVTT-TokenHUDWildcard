# Token HUD Wildcard for Foundry VTT
This is a really simple mondule for Foundry VTT that adds a button to the Token HUD if the corresponding token has Randomized Wildcard Images activated and more than 1 detected image.

When this HUD button is pressed, a small panel will be displayed on the right side of the token HUD with a list of buttons for each detected image from the Wildcard Images functionality. Pressing any of these will allow to easily change the image of the Token without opening the token configuration panel.

I made this module because having to open the Token Configuration to change the image or making a macro for each token I needed to be able to rotate images was too much of a bother.

Hopefully this module can help others!

_The token images were done by the amazing Ross McConnell at [2-Minute Tabletop](https://2minutetabletop.com/) and are part of the Hero Tokens 3 Pack._
